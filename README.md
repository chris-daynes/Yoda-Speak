##Synopsis

This code snippet uses the Mashable yoda speak API

To use, simply insert your text string into the text variable and run with node.

##Code Example

##Motivation

I have been playing around with APIs this week at EDA and this was just a fiddle on a Saturday morning

You will need your own ACCESS KEY from mashape for this to work. Here I am using the module dotenv to stop my keys from uploading to Github.

##Installation

This is a node.js codesnippet using unirest to grab the API from Mashable.
